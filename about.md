###Me
I am a certified software engineer with more than 15 years of relevant Java experience in different domains (education, healthcare, logistics, …). I am always looking for interesting tools, libraries and other technologies as he doesn’t want to reinvent the wheel all the time.

###My blog
In search of the technology to write blog posts about programming, I ran into Joshua Lande's post [How I Created a Beautiful and Minimal Blog Using Jekyll, Github Pages, and poole](http://joshualande.com/jekyll-github-pages-poole/). With his suggestions, I've managed to set up my own blog pretty easily. So, if you feel inspired, his blog is a great place to start. A big thanks for Joshua.
